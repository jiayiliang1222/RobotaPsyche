The study in this course throughout the semester is a meaningful experience to me. Through insightful discussions with classmates, I get to widen my understanding on the topic of robotics. 
	For the technical content, we learnt how to simulate and design our own ecosystems in Processing. The biggest takeaway here is that for many of the robots that display complicated behaviour and personalities, the algorithms are actually so much simpler than we thought. For example, I remember in the reading “Vehicle”, the little vehicle displays a character of being afraid. However, the basic logic here is just to let the vehicle leaves from where there is light. I enjoy the experience of trying to create my own ecosystem using the techniques learnt in class. I try to mimic how frogs and tadpoles live and grow in the pond. During this process, I realize that there are so many influential factors like sunlight and food source that could change the creatures’ behaviour, just like how people are influenced by multiple social and environmental factors, as well as how robots may be affected by receiving data and information from the outside world.  
	The readings and discussions with brilliant classmates are so inspiring. Previously, “robot” is just one vague, illusory, and far-off concept that only appears in science fictions as I believed that today we still has not got robots with extremely human-like appearances and high intelligence. However, I start to realize that the idea of robots have already been associated with our everyday lives. The topic of robots could be about tech toys, social media and avatars, mobile AI assistance, etc.. What is fascinating to me is that although we spend a lot of time discussing about the artificial robots, we seem to touch a lot upon the discussion about humans ourselves and our humanities. I remember we once talked about how robots/aliens are used as metaphors in science-ficional novels for minority groups and races like Jewish people and Gypsies. Treating robots is not only about what attitudes we humans should hold towards a fancy technologies, but about how we should treat someone that is similar to us, while different in some certain aspects. I am also impressed by the week about the Black Mirror episode which addresses the question of whether robots could develop human emotions. It is still a puzzle for us to solve about how emotion is generated inside our brains. And I start to wonder what emotions really mean to us — why emotion seems to be a necessary component for a humanoid?
