### Topic
The Impact of Gender Stereotypes on Robots
### Abstract
Robots, different from animal creatures, do not own physiological traits regarding the perspective of gender. However, a huge quantity of robots are designed with gender features artificially to fit with their functionality. For example, designers may attach masculinity to a guard robot to inform users of its strength. Also, most mobile smart assistants are equipped with female voices because people tend to regard females as more considerate and patient. Starting from the case study of Siri, which is a virtual robot assistant from Apple equipped with default female voice and selectable male voice, this paper explores how gender stereotypes influences the design of certain robots, and discusses whether the rise of robots will impact society's acknowledgement on genderality and femininity. 
### Research Questions 
- How gender stereotypes affect the decision of the robot designing process?
- To what extent are gender features improving robot performance?
- Are gender-based designs enhancing or weakening users’ gender attitudes?
- Is the subordination and serviceability of “female” assistant robots a reflection of male-gazing dominance?
- Which is the trend of future robot designs — gendering or non-gendering?
