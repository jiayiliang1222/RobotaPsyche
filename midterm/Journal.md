## 2.27
- Based on my previous project, I make a change that instead of having the tadpoles at the very beginning, the tadpoles occur where the frogs are one by one. 
This change is made to imitate the process of a frog bearing tadpoles. I realize this by putting the "tadpoles.add" in the draw function, and make the location same as the frog's location. 
I try to set up the lifespan and let the tadpoles disappear after a certain period of time. However, I fail to give out a workable boonlean statement to judge whether the tadpoles die, which is what I will work on for the future progress.

## 3.2
Adding the Arriving function to the tadpoles. Now Frogs do not attract the tadpoles, the tadpoles seek the frogs instead.

## 3.3
Adding the flocking to the tadpoles. Tadpoles will leave away from each other if they come too close.

## 3.8
Manage to make the tadpoles die through the Professor's suggestions! I set a value called lifespan and makes it decrease overtime. Once it becomes 0, one tadpole is removed from the list.

## 3.9
Adding the sunlight and make the tadpoles grow into little frogs. Adding more algae to the pond.
