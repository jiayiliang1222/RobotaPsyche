## Concept and Description
- This project is a continuation on my previous production assignment —— frog pond. The pond is mainly consisted of 5 elements — the frogs, the tadpoles, the food (algae), the light source, and little frogs. The ecosystem is designed to imitate real-life ecosystem where frogs give birth to tadpoles and tadpoles grow into frogs. 
- The ecosystem mainly follows the several rules:
  - Frogs bear tadpoles while they are swimming
  - Tadpoles Frogs bear tadpoles while they are swimming
  - Tadpoles seek and arrive at frogs 
  - Tadpoles are attracted by algae (food), and speed is affected by hunger level
  - Tadpoles share a behaviour of flocking (separation)
  - Tadpoles grow bigger after eating
  - Tadpoles die if they do not have enough food (determined the lifespan parameter)
  - Tadpoles become little frogs when having enough food and receiving light (determined by the growLevel parameter)
