## Concept
- This project is a continuation on my previous production assignment —— ecosystem. The pond is mainly consisted of three elements — the frogs, the tadpoles, and the food (algae). The ecosystem is designed to imitate real-life ecosystem and to explore how sets of DNAs could affect creature behaviours. The ecosystem mainly follows the several rules:
- Frogs bear tadpoles while they are swimming.
- Tadpoles are both attracted by frogs and the algae
- Hunger determines how greatly tadpoles are affected by food
- Tadpoles share a behaviour of blocking
- Tadpoles do the "arrive" (do not surpass) to the frogs when following the frogs
- (If possible), tadpoles becomes frogs when they eat the food certain times
